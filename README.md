# Servo Motor Control using PWM - STM32 (Blue Pill)

This project demonstrates how to control a servo motor using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) on an STM32F103C8T6 (Blue Pill) microcontroller. The STM32 generates PWM signals that control the position of a servo motor. This project is built using STM32CubeIDE.

## Features
- Control a servo motor's position using hardware PWM.
- Adjustable duty cycle to control servo angle.
- Configurable PWM frequency for servo motor operation.
- Example code to drive standard hobby servos (e.g., SG90).
